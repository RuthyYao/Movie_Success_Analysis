**Author**: [Ruthy Yao ](mailto:ruthy.yao@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project analyses the key successful factors of a movie studio to prepare Microsoft to enter the movie production market. Description analysis of the populairty score, worldwide gross revenue, gross profit and the movie release moonth shows that the best performing genres are animations, Sci-fi and adventures anbd the best release month of a year are May, July and Novemeber. In addition, Microsoft should consider allocating at least $500m to production budget each year to run the new studio.

## Business Problem

As a new entrant to the movie production market, Microsoft has limited industry knowledge. To complete with globally well-established production companies with generally over seven to eight decades of history, it is imperative to dive into the vast movie database to distill insights on where to start, when to start and how much funding is required. This will help Microsoft to better allocate the resources and increase the chances of success. 

## Data and Methods

The analysis is built on the data collated from four well-known movie databases - IMDB, The Numbers, The Movie DataBase and Box Office Mojo. Consolidation of the four datasets brings in over 2000 movies released between 2010 and 2018. Each movie is featured with genre, release date, studio, popularity score, gross revenue and production budget.

The project uses descriptive analysis, including description of the average popularity and gross revenue by genres, the year-over-year production budget of an average studio and the trend/pattern of box office performance on a month-by-month basis over nine years' period. This provides valuable data insights to support the success of the new studio.
